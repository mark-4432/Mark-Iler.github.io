Hello!
Right out of college, I entered a contest for Motorola for the 68HC05 chip family. I had a project that I wanted to do to design and build a bicycle cyclometer. This chipset has a limited set of commands and found that I did not have to limit myself to those and natively access other commands in the 68HCxxx family to leverage floating point arithmetic.  Using code that I wrote with this expanded set of instructions allowed me to complete the project with a small set of peripheral components.

As a manual QA Engineer, I have leveraged my EE degree in every role that I have worked in and enjoy working at the command line. VAX VMS, and Linux I learned the basics early in life and enjoy working with shell commands in Bash and have a bit of knowledge of VIM.

Currently, I am working on improving my skill sets in:
Postman - currently, I am taking an extensive course in Postman as what I learned on the job, needed reinforcement. In fact some things my devs’ told me they did not know in the interworking of Postman, I am getting a strong foundation of now in Udemy coursework. I know how to write pre/post scripts and can put together collections to run automation with Newman.
Python
I have written a few scripts in the past along with other tools such as AutoIt3.
I helped our lead Automator at TSW write, edit, and refactor scripts for E2E testing.
Currently, I am gaining deeper knowledge in OOP and Python through coursework on O’Reilly Learning and Udemy.
I know some JS and the use of the browser Console in finding locators and am well versed in finding locators with CSS, XPATH etc.
I am taking a course in Udemy on the Selenium 4 driver.
Performance
I am taking a course in K6 and one in GitLab as these would be useful knowledge in Assisting DevOps teams.
I had minimal exposure to K6 at TSW, as they had me simply running their scripts when we were testing bottlenecks.
Git, and Github, I am using daily in all aspects of my learning.

I am also taking a paid set of coursework via Serenity-Dojo
Relearning Java now and I will update with certs from that course as I finish it there.
